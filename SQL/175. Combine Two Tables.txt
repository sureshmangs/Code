Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, 
regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

FirstName, LastName, City, State









Solution:

Since the PersonId in table Address is the foreign key of table Person, 
we can join this two table to get the address information of a person.

Considering there might not be an address information for every person, 
we should use outer join instead of the default inner join.

Note: Using where clause to filter the records will fail if there is no address 
information for a person because it will not display the name information.


SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State 
FROM Person LEFT JOIN Address 
ON Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId;
